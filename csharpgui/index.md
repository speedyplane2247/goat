# Csharp Visual
This GOAT is written in Visual C#, and is a GUI program. Not only does it contain its file size withih itself, but it also has data stored within itself, that is retrieved from a button.
## Compile
You can do this with almost any C# IDE, I did this in Visual C# 2015, so most modern ones will work.
